# KickIt
### Summary
In this project, I will be developing a two-player 90-second-long football
game. With this, I also aim to include a leaderboard so all the winners can see
the highest goal difference they won by. They would also be able to search for
their name and sort the leaderboard to see the highest goal difference players
have won by.
The end-user of my program would be any person of any age looking for a
little break/entertainment with their friend. More specifically, it would appeal
to football fans and a younger audience. The leaderboard adds a competitive
element to the game as you could even compete to be the best through the
leaderboard by achieving the highest goal differences. This application would
be very user-friendly, ensuring people of all ages are able to play it without
any problems.
This project meets the need for an advanced higher project as it will be
connected to a database which stores all the names and respective scores
which would be then displayed on the leaderboard. This would be done using
SQL queries to calculate the winners and goaldifference. End users would also
be able to sort the list and search for their name. This would be done using
bubble sort and binary search algorithms.
