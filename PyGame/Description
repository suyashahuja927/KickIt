In this project, I will be developing a two-player 90-second-long football game. 
With this, I also aim to include a leaderboard so all the winners can see the highest goal difference they won by.
They would also be able to search for their name and sort the leaderboard to see the highest goal difference players have won by. 
The end-user of my program would be any person of any age looking for a little break/entertainment with their friend.
More specifically, it would appeal to football fans and a younger audience.
The leaderboard adds a competitive element to the game as you could even compete to be the best through the leaderboard by achieving the highest goal differences.
This application would be very user-friendly, ensuring people of all ages are able to play it without any problems. 
This project meets the need for an advanced higher project as it will be connected to a database which stores all the names and respective scores which would be then displayed on the leaderboard.
This would be done using SQL queries to calculate the winners and goaldifference. End users would also be able to sort the list and search for their name.
This would be done using bubble sort and binary search algorithms.
